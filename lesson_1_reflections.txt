How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is kind of back-tracking function but no location indexes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Once you want to change a portion of the code, it is easy to reflesh your memory.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: following logical thoughts
    cons: tedious

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The other version control systems do not ckeck the cross-links between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First, you have to go into the folder before executing "git log" to view the history, followed by using "git diff old_id new_id" to see the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It can debug more efficiently.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    test what I have learned.
